#### Just

<p>

A JSON-serializable Just data-structure

</p>


```typescript

export interface Just<A> {
  readonly '@typed/Just': A
}

```


#### Just.of\<A\>(value: A): Just\<A\>

<p>

Creates a Just given a value.

</p>


<details>
<summary>See the code</summary>

```typescript

export function of<A>(value: A): Just<A> {
  return { '@typed/Just': value }
}
}

```

</details>
<hr />


#### Maybe.of\<A\>(value: A): Maybe\<A\>

<p>

Creates a Maybe containing a value. If the value is `undefined` or `null`
a `Nothing` will be returned. All other values will be wrapped in a `Just`.

</p>


<details>
<summary>See the code</summary>

```typescript

export const of: <A>(value: A | void) => Maybe<A> = toMaybe
}

```

</details>
<hr />


#### Nothing

<p>

The Nothing type, used in place of nulls or undefined.

</p>


```typescript

export interface Nothing {
  readonly '@typed/Nothing': true
}
export const Nothing: Nothing = { '@typed/Nothing': true }

```


#### ap\<A, B\>(fn: Maybe\<(value: A) =\> B\>, value: Maybe\<A\>): Maybe\<B\>

<p>

Applies the function contained in a `Maybe` to the value contained in a
second `Maybe`.

</p>


<details>
<summary>See the code</summary>

```typescript

export const ap: MaybeAp = curry2(__ap)

function __ap<A, B>(fn: Maybe<(value: A) => B>, maybe: Maybe<A>): Maybe<B> {
  return chain(f => map(f, maybe), fn)
}

export interface MaybeAp {
  <A, B>(fn: Maybe<(value: A) => B>, value: Maybe<A>): Maybe<B>
  <A, B>(fn: Maybe<(value: A) => B>): (value: Maybe<A>) => Maybe<B>
}

```

export const combine: Combine = curry3(__combine)
